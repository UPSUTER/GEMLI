\title{
quantify_clusters_iterative
}
\description{
This function clusters the input matrix repeatedly until a desired cluster size is reached.
}
\usage{
quantify_clusters_iterative(data_matrix, marker_genes, N=2, fast=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{
  data_matrix}{'data_matrix' is a quality controlled and normalized gene expression matrix where rownames are genes (features) and column names are cell IDs (samples).
  }
  \item{
  marker_genes}{'marker_genes' is a vector of gene names or IDs of potential lineage marker genes. It is automatically created in the 'predict_lineages' function or can be computed manually using the 'potential_markers' function.
  }
  \item{
  N}{'N' describes in how many branches the data matrix is split in each clustering step. Higher numbers speed up the clustering but can negatively impact the result of the prediction. It is highly recommended to keep the default value, 2.
  }
  \item{
  fast}{'fast' =TRUE uses the HiClimR package for calculating correlations. This makes the function faster but less precise. The default is FALSE.
  }
}
\value{
The output is a matrix that indicates which cells (rows) cluster together in each iteration (colums). It is used in the 'predict_lineages' function.
